# Shaping
"one of the hardest games" -Bailey Russo

### A game that is a combination of luck and skill


# Proposal

### Story
Some games have absolutely no story at all and it's simply abstract. Well, that's the case with this game. There is no story at all, the only point to the game is to make sure you have fun and come back for more. 

### Genre 
This is a mixture of two genres, education, and strategy. 

Education: Everyone has to learn their shapes eventually, so why not play this game to learn.

Strategy: You have to become very skilled in order to beat the very hard level that are really quick.

### Controls

1. Keyboard -no mouse
2. Touch (Mobile and PC)

### Player Learning
Anyone will be able to play this game regardless of their age.

### Esthetics:
1. Graphics: Childish
2. Sounds: A combination of many 1980's game sounds

The game looks like it was meant for little kids under the age of twelve. However, I believe that a lot of people like that because it's unique, and gives the user something different than what they're use to.

### Gameplay:

1. Fast decision making
2. Have four options per each turn 
3. Only have three lives
4. Swipe: UP, Down, Left, Right to try and match with the corresponding shape
5. The shapes change every few seconds


### About the Developer:
My name is Bailey Russo. I'm a second year transfer student from GCC. Currently, I'm taking Game Design and Development because I believe that games give people a lasting experience that they will never forger. I love all aspects of game development including: sound, art, 3d modeling, and especially coding. I have experience with: Adobe Suite, Maya, Visual Studio, and Microsoft Applications. 

### Creation/Thought process
I was sitting in my room thinking about a game to make and all of a sudden I was like "What about a game about shapes." I know that there is a lot on the market currently but I wanted to do something different. I believe that I can actually create this game in this class.
